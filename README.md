## Project-3 proposal

The objective of this project is to develop data visualization web application that will have user driven interactions. The project focused on Hydraulic fracturing, or fracing.

The fracking related open databases will be accessed from hydraulic fracturing chemical disclosure registry. 

[Frac Data](https://www.fracfocus.org/index.php?p=data-download)

The database from the above source will be extracted, transformed, and then uploaded as relational database using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. The SQL database will be used to build dashboards. These dashboards will show locations of wells that have been  stimulated by hydraulic fracturing.  The dashboards will include leaflet visualizations
* show number of wells/year
* operational locations of various E&Ps (companies)
* volume of water used for fracking
* Depth of wells
